# PIG GAME

## Overview
This is a very fun game in which the first player to reach 100 points wins! A player receives points with each roll of the dice. Points received equals the number rolled on the dice. A player's turn only ends when they decide to either hold their points or they roll a 1. When a player holds, their points get accumulated and they are able to add any points from future dice rolls to these accumulated points on their way to becoming a winner at 100 points. However, if a player rolls a 1 all their points from their current dice rolls are lost (not their accumulated points) and it is immediately the other plays turn to roll the dice.

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out a fully functional and interactive JavaScript game with features such as player turn states, keeping players scores and reflecting scores in the DOM, displaying a dice image based upon dice roll, adding event listeners for all buttons in the game and adding functionality to reset the game.

- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

Learned to build an interactive and fully functional JavaScript game utilizing the following:
- DOM Manipulation 
  - Used classList method to add/remove and toggle between classes
- Functions
- Generating random number with Math.random method
- Displaying different dice images depending on what random number was generated
- If and or statements
- Ternary Operators
- Event Listeners
  - Adding and removing classes from elements based upon click event.
- Emoji's
- Animation of winning message using transform property which scaled and translated the message.

### Continued development

Looking forward to continuing to obtain valuable skills through the use of building applications and competing in challenges.
